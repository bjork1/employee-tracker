# employee-tracker

This project is a functional employee tracker that allows the user to view and edit company information.

To start the application, the user will need to enter "node tracker.js" into the terminal.

The file is linked to the tracker_data database in MySql - all of the queries for the original database prior to any edits are shown in the queries.sql file.

The user will have several options to choose from in the terminal, which include viewing the employee, position, and department data in a table format; the user also has the option to add to the employee, position, or department data by entering the prompts into the terminal. If the user knows the position ID and would like to update an employees position, they can do that as well by selecting the option in the program.

This program will cost $10,000 per employee to use with your organization - sign up today to get in early. The next update to the program will include the option to update manager data.
